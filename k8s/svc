üìò Kubernetes Networking & Service Types Explained (Simple Terms)
This guide explains in plain language:

‚úÖ How Kubernetes assigns IPs
‚úÖ What CIDRs are
‚úÖ How ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services work

üåø 1Ô∏è‚É£ How IP Addresses Are Assigned in Kubernetes
Kubernetes has different kinds of IP addresses:

Node IPs

Each worker node has an IP on your cloud or network.
Example:
Node1: 192.168.1.10
Node2: 192.168.1.11
Pod IPs

Each pod gets a unique IP from the Pod CIDR range.
Example Pod CIDR: 10.244.0.0/16
Example pod IPs:
PodA: 10.244.1.5
PodB: 10.244.1.6
Service IPs (ClusterIP)

Each Service gets a virtual IP from the Service CIDR range.
Example Service CIDR: 10.96.0.0/12
Example ClusterIP: 10.96.33.8
‚úÖ Important:

Pod IPs are internal only.
Service IPs (ClusterIP) are internal only unless you create NodePort or LoadBalancer.
üì¶ 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Is CIDR?
CIDR = a way to define an IP range.

Pod CIDR: Range for all pod IPs.
Service CIDR: Range for all ClusterIPs.
Example:

Pod CIDR = 10.244.0.0/16
Service CIDR = 10.96.0.0/12
Kubernetes picks IPs from these ranges automatically.

üîµ 3Ô∏è‚É£ ClusterIP Service (Internal Access)
‚úÖ Default service type.

Gives a stable internal IP to reach your pods.
No external access.
How it works:

You create a Deployment (pods).
You create a ClusterIP Service.
Kubernetes assigns an internal IP (e.g., 10.96.33.8).
Other pods can connect via that IP or DNS name.
Example YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
‚úÖ To access:

http://my-app:80
‚úÖ Use Case:

Internal communication between pods.
üü¢ 4Ô∏è‚É£ NodePort Service (Basic External Access)
‚úÖ Makes your service reachable via the node‚Äôs IP and a high port number.

Kubernetes picks a port in range 30000‚Äì32767.
You can connect to NodeIP:NodePort externally.
How it works:

Create a NodePort Service.
Kubernetes assigns a port, e.g., 30080.
Traffic comes to node‚Äôs IP on that port and forwards to pods.
Example YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080
‚úÖ To access:

http://<NodeIP>:30080
‚úÖ Use Case:

Quick external testing without a load balancer.
üü£ 5Ô∏è‚É£ LoadBalancer Service (Public Access)
‚úÖ Easiest way to get a public IP in the cloud.

Creates an external load balancer (AWS ELB, Azure LB, etc.).
Allocates a public cloud IP automatically.
Routes traffic to your pods.
How it works:

Create a LoadBalancer Service.
Cloud provider assigns a public IP.
Requests hit that IP and are load-balanced to pods.
Example YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-lb
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
‚úÖ To access:

http://<PublicIP>
‚úÖ Use Case:

Production apps needing public access.
üõ†Ô∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ How IP Assignments Happen
Step by step:

‚úÖ Pod IP assignment:

Kubelet on each node talks to the CNI plugin.
CNI allocates an IP from the pod CIDR for that node.
‚úÖ Service IP assignment:

Kubernetes control plane picks a free IP from the Service CIDR.
That becomes the ClusterIP.
‚úÖ NodePort assignment:

Kubernetes picks a port in 30000‚Äì32767 (or you specify it).
Nodes listen on that port.
‚úÖ LoadBalancer assignment:

Cloud provider assigns a public IP and sets up a load balancer.
‚ú® Summary Table
Service Type	Internal IP (ClusterIP)	External IP	How to Access
ClusterIP	Yes	No	Inside cluster only
NodePort	Yes	Node IP:NodePort	Outside via node IP and port
LoadBalancer	Yes	Public IP	Outside via cloud load balancer
üéØ Quick Example Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ You create a Deployment (pods get Pod IPs).
2Ô∏è‚É£ You create a Service:

ClusterIP ‚Üí Internal-only
NodePort ‚Üí NodeIP:Port
LoadBalancer ‚Üí Public IP
‚úÖ Tips for Beginners:

Always start with ClusterIP for internal communication.
Use NodePort or LoadBalancer for external access.
Know your Pod CIDR and Service CIDR ranges.
Use kubectl get svc to see assigned IPs.
