🌐 Hosting a Static Website Using AWS S3 Bucket
This guide explains how to create an S3 bucket, upload your static website data, and make it publicly accessible.

🗂️ What Type of Data Can You Store in S3?
You can store any kind of digital file, including:

📄 Documents: PDF, Word files, spreadsheets
🖼️ Images: JPG, PNG, GIF
🎥 Videos: MP4, MOV
🎵 Audio: MP3, WAV
🗄️ Backups: Database dumps, zip archives
📝 Logs: Text files from applications
💻 Software packages: .zip, .tar.gz
🌐 Static website files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
📦 Bucket Types
General bucket: No slashes in object keys.
Directory-style bucket: Uses slashes (/) to visually organize keys.
✅ In this example, we are using a General bucket.

🏷️ Bucket Naming
Bucket names must be unique across all AWS regions.
Example: ganrajs3webpage
🔒 Understanding ACL (Access Control List)
ACL controls who can access your bucket and objects and what permissions they have:

Permissions you can set:

Read – Download/List
Write – Upload/Delete
Read ACP – Read ACL
Write ACP – Write ACL
Full Control
You assign these to:

The owner account
Other AWS accounts
Everyone (⚠️ Be cautious—public access)
🔄 Versioning
Enables you to maintain multiple versions of an object (e.g., V1, V2).
Useful for recovering from accidental overwrites or deletions.
🚀 Steps to Host Your Static Website
Create the bucket

Example: ganrajs3webpage
Upload your website data

You can drag and drop files, or use the console to upload.
👉 You can download the webpage data from here
Enable Static Website Hosting

Specify your index.html as the main page.
Optionally, set an error document (e.g., error.html).
Configure Permissions

Make your bucket publicly accessible:
Go to Permissions
Untick the "Block all public access" checkbox
Save changes
Allow ACL for the bucket and objects.
Make Uploaded Objects Public

Go to Objects
Select all files
Use Actions > Make public using ACL
Confirm changes.
Update Files

If you re-upload files:
Make them public again (or the updated webpage will not display)
If versioning is enabled, you will see multiple versions.
Get the Website URL

Go to Properties tab
Copy the Bucket website endpoint URL
Paste it into your browser to see your website live.
💡 Notes
Always be cautious with public access settings.
Consider enabling versioning to protect against accidental data loss.
For production use, you may want to configure CloudFront CDN and HTTPS.
✅ Enjoy hosting your static site on AWS S3!
