# NAT Gateway vs Internet Gateway in AWS

When designing AWS network architectures, choosing between—or accurately combining—NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway is crucial for controlling connectivity and securing resources. Here’s a clear breakdown:

---

## Internet Gateway (IGW)

- **Purpose:** Enables resources within your VPC (such as EC2 instances in public subnets) to communicate directly with the internet.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Supports both inbound (from internet to AWS resource) and outbound (from resource to internet) traffic.
- **Public Connectivity:** Instances must have a public IP address (or Elastic IP) to use the Internet Gateway.
- **Typical Use Case:** Web servers or load balancers that must be accessible from the internet.
- **Cost:** No additional charge for creating or using an IGW[2][3][6].

---

## NAT Gateway (NGW)

- **Purpose:** Allows resources in a private subnet to initiate outbound connections to the internet (for updates, API calls, etc.), while preventing inbound connections initiated from the internet.
- **Outbound Connections Only:** Blocks any unsolicited inbound internet traffic; does not allow the internet to initiate any communication with private subnet resources.
- **Private Connectivity:** Used for instances in private subnets that do not have public IPs, but still require internet access for tasks like software updates.
- **High Availability:** Must be deployed per availability zone for zone-level redundancy.
- **Requirement:** NAT Gateway must be in a public subnet and requires an Elastic IP.
- **Cost:** Hourly charge plus data transfer fees[2][3][6].

## Key Differences Table

| Feature                  | Internet Gateway                        | NAT Gateway                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Traffic Direction        | Inbound and outbound                    | Outbound only (initiated from VPC resource)  |
| Use Case                 | Public-facing resources (web servers)   | Private resources needing internet access    |
| IP Requirement           | Public IP (or Elastic IP) required      | Private IP (no public IP)                    |
| Inbound Connections      | Allowed                                 | Blocked                                      |
| Outbound Connections     | Allowed                                 | Allowed                                      |
| Subnet Type              | Public                                  | Private                                      |
| Redundancy               | Highly available (default)              | Per AZ deployment for redundancy             |
| Cost                     | Free                                    | Charged (per hour & data processed)          |

## When to Use Each

- **Internet Gateway:** Use when you need your AWS resources (like EC2 instances) to be publicly accessible from the internet—such as for a web or application server.
- **NAT Gateway:** Use when your resources (like databases, backend servers) should stay private but need outgoing internet access—such as pulling software updates—without risking exposure to inbound traffic[2][3][6].

---

**Tip:** Often, real-world AWS architectures leverage both: a public subnet with an IGW for load balancers or web servers, and private subnets with a NAT Gateway for backend resources.
