NAT Gateway: Public Server Internet to Private Server (via VPC)
🧩 Use Case
We want to give internet access to a private EC2 instance (no public IP) via a public EC2 server using a NAT Gateway, without directly exposing the private server to the internet.

📶 Step-by-Step Summary
1. Create a Custom VPC
CIDR Block: 192.168.0.0/16
Purpose: Isolate from default VPC; gain full control over subnets and routing.
2. Create Two Subnets
Type	CIDR	Auto-Assign Public IP
Public Subnet	192.168.0.0/17	Enabled ✅
Private Subnet	192.168.128.0/18	Disabled ❌
Both can be in the same availability zone.

3. Set Subnet IP Assignment
Go to Subnet settings → Edit → Uncheck “Auto-assign public IPv4” for private subnet.
Enable for public subnet.
4. Route Table Behavior
VPC auto-generates a route table per subnet.
No Internet Gateway (IGW) by default in custom VPCs.
IGW must be created and attached manually.
5. Create and Attach Internet Gateway (IGW)
Create IGW, attach to your custom VPC.
Update the public subnet's route table:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: igw-xxxxxxxx
6. Create NAT Gateway
Must be deployed in the public subnet.
Requires an Elastic IP (EIP).
Allows:
✅ Outbound access for private servers
❌ No inbound access from internet
7. Create Route Table for Private Subnet
Associate only with private subnet.
Add NAT Gateway in the route:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 → Target: nat-xxxxxxxx
8. Launch EC2 Instances
Public EC2 Instance
Subnet: Public
Auto-assign IP: Yes
Security Group:
SSH (22) from your IP
HTTP/HTTPS as needed
Private EC2 Instance
Subnet: Private
Auto-assign IP: No
Uses NAT for internet access
9. Access Private Server via Public EC2 (Bastion Method)
Tools Used: MobaXterm
SSH into public EC2 using .pem key
Upload private EC2 key to public server
Run:
chmod 400 Linux.pem
ssh -i 'Linux.pem' ec2-user@<Private-EC2-Private-IP>
🧠 Key Concepts
Concept	Description
NAT Gateway	Allows outbound internet for private subnets. Must be in public subnet.
Bastion Host	Public EC2 used to access private EC2s.
IGW (Internet Gateway)	Needed for public subnet internet access.
Elastic IP	Static public IP for NAT gateway.
Route Table	Defines routing via IGW or NAT per subnet.
Security Group	Manages instance access (SSH, HTTP, etc).
✅ Final Outcome
✅ Public EC2: Has internet + SSH
✅ Private EC2: Internet via NAT, no direct public access
✅ SSH into private only through public (bastion/jump host)
