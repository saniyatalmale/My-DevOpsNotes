# 🌍 AWS Regions and Availability Zones

---

## 🗺️ Region

A **Region** is a **geographical location** where AWS hosts its data centers. Each region is an **independent area** that consists of multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

### 🔹 Examples of Regions:
- `us-east-1` → North Virginia, USA
- `ap-south-1` → Mumbai, India
- `eu-west-1` → Ireland

### ✅ Key Points:
- Regions are isolated from each other.
- You choose a region based on **latency**, **data residency**, and **compliance**.
- Services and pricing may differ across regions.

## 🏢 Availability Zone (AZ)

An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is one or more discrete **data centers** within a region. Each AZ is isolated but connected with **high-speed, low-latency links** to other AZs in the same region.

### 🔹 Examples of AZs:
- `ap-south-1a`
- `ap-south-1b`
- `us-east-1a`

### ✅ Key Points:
- Each AZ has independent **power**, **cooling**, and **networking**.
- Used to design fault-tolerant and **highly available** applications.
- Placing resources across AZs protects against data center failure.
