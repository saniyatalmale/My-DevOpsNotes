## 🔹 1. Why use Docker

### 📌 What is it?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit called a **container**.

### 🔧 What else is used instead?

| Alternative           | Common Use Case                         | Limitations                                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Virtual Machines (VMs) | OS-level isolation                      | Heavier, slower boot, more resource use             |
| Bare-metal installs    | Legacy / high-perf systems              | Hard to replicate or migrate                        |
| Serverless (Lambda)    | Stateless, event-driven workloads       | Unsuitable for complex/stateful apps                |
| PaaS (e.g. Heroku)     | Simplified app deployment               | Vendor lock-in, limited control                     |

### ✅ Pros

- ⚡ Fast boot times
- 📦 Portability across environments
- 🧪 Great for CI/CD and testing
- 🚀 Optimized for microservices
- 🔁 Lightweight & efficient

### ❌ Cons

- 🔐 Shared kernel (not full isolation)
- 📂 Ephemeral storage
- 📈 Requires orchestration at scale

### 📌 When to use Docker

| Use Case                  | Containers | VMs   | Serverless | Bare Metal |
|---------------------------|------------|-------|------------|------------|
| Web/Microservices         | ✅ Best    | ⚠️ OK | ⚠️ Stateless only | ❌ No       |
| Stateful apps             | ⚠️ Volume mgmt | ✅ Best | ❌ No       | ✅ OK       |
| Custom kernel modules     | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes| ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      |

### 🧠 Rule of Thumb

Use Docker when you need **portability, speed, and consistency** across environments. Use VMs for full OS control, and serverless for short-lived logic.

---

## 🔹 2. Dockerfile

### 📌 What is it?

A `Dockerfile` is a declarative script that defines how an image is built using layers of instructions like `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`, and `CMD`.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative        | Drawback                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Manual image setup | Not reproducible                           |
| Shell scripts      | Not container-native                       |
| Prebuilt images    | No customization                           |

### ✅ Pros

- 📜 Declarative, trackable
- 💾 Layer caching improves builds
- 🔐 Customizable dependency chain

### ❌ Cons

- 🐛 Easy to bloat images
- 🧩 Debugging can be hard

### 📦 Example

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use minimal base images
- Pin versions
- Optimize layer order
- Use `.dockerignore`

### 📌 When to use

| Scenario                          | Use Dockerfile? |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Custom build steps               | ✅ Yes          |
| Reusing existing images          | ❌ No           |
| CI/CD controlled builds          | ✅ Yes          |

### 🧠 Rule of Thumb

Use Dockerfile for **custom images**, especially when reproducibility or CI/CD integration is important.

---

## 🔹 3. Building Images

### 📌 What is it?

The process of converting a `Dockerfile` into a runnable container image using the `docker build` command. The image is composed of read-only layers defined by each Dockerfile instruction.

Note: You can partially reverse-engineer a Dockerfile from a container image, but **you will never get the original Dockerfile exactly as written**

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative        | Drawback                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Manual container snapshots | Not reproducible                 |
| Base-only images           | No application logic included    |

### ✅ Pros

- 📦 Reproducible build artifacts
- 🚀 Layer caching accelerates rebuilds
- 🔐 Precise control of base and dependencies

### ❌ Cons

- 🐘 Large image size if not optimized
- 🔄 Cache invalidation can be tricky

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds
- Tag images with version/hash
- Use `--no-cache` for clean rebuilds when needed

### 📌 When to use

| Use Case                        | Build Images? |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Production deployment            | ✅ Yes        |
| Dev-only containers              | ✅ Usually    |
| Using fully prebuilt base apps   | ❌ No         |

---

## 🔹 4. Running Containers

### 📌 What is it?

Launching a container from a built image using `docker run`, optionally defining volumes, ports, environment variables, and network behavior.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative     | Drawback                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| VM snapshots    | Heavy and inflexible               |
| Manual process  | No reproducibility                 |

### ✅ Pros

- ⚙️ Rapid start/stop
- 🧪 Ideal for test/dev cycles
- 🔁 Easily restarted or scaled

### ❌ Cons

- ⚠️ Volatile filesystem unless volumes used
- 🧩 Limited persistent service management without orchestration

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp:latest
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use `--rm` for ephemeral use
- Use `-d` for detached mode
- Use `--name` for container naming

### 📌 When to use

| Scenario                  | Use docker run? |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Testing image locally     | ✅ Yes          |
| Permanent services        | ⚠️ Use Compose/Swarm |
| Running one-off scripts   | ✅ Ideal        |

---

## 🔹 5. Logs

### 📌 What is it?

Docker provides logging through the container’s stdout/stderr streams, viewable via `docker logs`.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative       | Limitation                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Syslog/Nginx logs | Not container-aware                  |
| File-based logs   | Not standardized across containers   |

### ✅ Pros

- 🔎 Easy to access (`docker logs <container>`)
- 🔗 Streamed to logging drivers

### ❌ Cons

- 📁 Logs lost on container delete (unless persisted)
- ⛔ Log size growth not managed by default

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker logs myapp_container
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use log rotation
- Forward logs to central logging systems (e.g. ELK, Loki)

### 📌 When to use

| Logging Type       | Use Docker logs? |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Dev debugging       | ✅ Ideal         |
| Production logging  | ⚠️ Needs forwarder |
| Stateful apps       | ⚠️ Persist logs  |

---

## 🔹 6. Inspecting

### 📌 What is it?

Using `docker inspect` or `docker ps` to examine container/image metadata (network, mounts, runtime config, etc.)

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative     | Drawback                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Manual config   | Not introspectable                |
| Monitoring tools| High-level view only              |

### ✅ Pros

- 🧠 Deep introspection of objects
- ⚙️ Useful for debugging, scripting

### ❌ Cons

- 🧾 JSON-heavy output
- 🧩 Not user-friendly without formatting

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker inspect myapp_container
docker ps -a
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use `--format` for parsing
- Combine with `jq` or shell scripts for automation

Some examples:

Get the container's IP address:
>docker inspect my_container | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.IPAddress'

List all environment variables
>docker inspect my_container | jq -r '.[0].Config.Env[]'

List mounted volumes (host path → container path)
>docker inspect my_container | jq -r '.[0].Mounts[] | "\(.Source) → \(.Destination)"'

Get the ENTRYPOINT and CMD
>docker inspect my_container | jq -r '.[0].Config.Entrypoint, .[0].Config.Cmd'

Get published ports and mappings
>docker inspect my_container | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.Ports'

**Bash automation scripts:**

List all running containers with their base images
```
for id in $(docker ps -q); do
  name=$(docker inspect --format '{{.Name}}' $id | sed 's/\///')
  image=$(docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Image}}' $id)
  echo "$name uses image $image"
done
```

Get image size of each container (via history)
```
for img in $(docker ps --format '{{.Image}}'); do
  echo "Inspecting $img"
  docker history $img | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}'
done
```

Summarize how many containers use each base image
```
docker ps -a --format '{{.Image}}' | sort | uniq -c
```

Warn if container uses `latest` tag
```
docker ps --format '{{.Image}}' | grep ':latest' && echo "❗ Some containers use latest — not recommended"
```

Create an audit log of all running containers
```
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
mkdir -p audits
for id in $(docker ps -q); do
  docker inspect $id > audits/${id}_${timestamp}.json
done
```

### 📌 When to use

| Use Case                    | Use inspect? |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Debugging networking issues | ✅ Yes       |
| Monitoring deployments      | ✅ Yes       |
| End-user troubleshooting    | ⚠️ Too technical |

---

## 🔹 7. Process ID (PID 1)

### 📌 What is it?

In Docker, the main application process inside a container always runs as **PID 1**. This has implications for **signal handling** and **process reaping**.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative | Drawback                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Supervisor/init system in VMs | Overhead in containers         |

### ✅ Pros

- 📌 Clear entrypoint for containers
- 🔧 Control over lifecycle

### ❌ Cons

- ⚠️ PID 1 ignores some signals (e.g. SIGTERM)
- ⚠️ Orphaned zombie processes if not reaped

### 📦 Example

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use a process manager like `tini` or `dumb-init`
- Trap and forward signals in shell scripts

### 📌 When to care

| Scenario                     | PID 1 Matters? |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Graceful shutdown handling  | ✅ Yes         |
| Multi-process containers    | ✅ Yes         |
| Simple dev/test container   | ⚠️ Maybe       |

---

## 🔹 8. Volumes

### 📌 What is it?

Docker **volumes** are persistent storage objects managed by Docker, mounted into containers at runtime. They are **decoupled from the container lifecycle**, meaning data persists even after the container is removed.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Method               | What It Is                        | When to Use                           | Limitations                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Named volumes**    | Docker-managed persistent volumes | 🟢 Best for most stateful containers  | Must be managed via Docker CLI/API    |
| **Bind mounts**      | Host path mapped into container   | 🟠 Good for dev/test with local files | Not portable; tied to host filesystem |
| **tmpfs**            | RAM-only mount inside container   | 🟠 In-memory caching or secrets       | Data disappears on container restart  |
| **External drivers** | e.g., NFS, EBS, Ceph via plugin   | 🟢 Multi-host shared volume scenarios | Needs plugin, network latency         |
### ✅ Pros

- 💾 Data persists across container restarts and re-creates
    
- 🔐 Separation of data and app logic = easier upgrades
    
- 📦 Optimized by Docker for cross-platform performance
    

### ❌ Cons

- 🧹 Volume cleanup requires explicit commands (`docker volume rm`)
    
- ⚠️ File permissions can be misaligned (UID/GID mismatches)
    
- 🧱 Complex setups (NFS, CIFS) need Docker volume plugins

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker volume create db-vol
docker run -v db-vol:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

Or with bind mounts:
```
docker run -v /home/user/config:/app/config myapp
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

| Use Case                        | Recommendation                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Databases, uploads, logs**    | ✅ Use named volumes (portable, managed)    |
| **Development with host files** | ⚠️ Use bind mounts (host-path ↔ container) |
| **Secrets in memory**           | ⚠️ Use `tmpfs` volumes                     |
| **Multi-node clusters**         | ✅ Use volume plugins or Kubernetes PVCs    |
### 📌 When to use

| Scenario                      | Use Named Volumes? | Use Bind Mounts? | Use tmpfs? |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Persist MySQL data            | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No             | ❌ No       |
| Mount config files during dev | ⚠️ Maybe           | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No       |
| Store in-memory session cache | ❌ No               | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes      |


### 🔹 How Named Volumes Work in Docker

#### 📌 What happens when you create a named volume?

```bash
docker volume create db-vol
```

Docker creates an entry in its **volume store**, typically at:

```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/db-vol/_data
```

This path is **abstracted** — Docker manages it internally.

---

#### 📦 How it's mounted in a container

```bash
docker run -v db-vol:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

Docker performs:

1. **Lookup** for `db-vol` in its volume store.
2. **Mounts** `/var/lib/docker/volumes/db-vol/_data` to `/var/lib/mysql` in the container.
3. **Manages** access, lifecycle, and cleanup.

---

#### 🌍 Why it's considered portable

Named volumes are:
- Declared in `docker run`, `docker-compose.yml`, or Swarm YAML.
- Always refer to **Docker-managed locations**, regardless of host OS.
- Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, WSL, and Docker Desktop.

You can `docker-compose up` on any machine — Docker handles the storage behind `db-vol`.

---

#### 🔍 Inspecting the backing path

```bash
docker volume inspect db-vol
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "Name": "db-vol",
  "Driver": "local",
  "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/db-vol/_data"
}
```

---

#### 🛠 Custom volume location (advanced)

You can override the storage path using `driver_opts` in Compose:

```yaml
volumes:
  db-vol:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: /mnt/fast-disk/mysql-data
```

This creates a volume mounted from a custom host folder.

---

#### ✅ Summary Table

| Feature                     | Named Volumes     | Bind Mounts         |
|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Path management            | Docker-managed    | You specify path    |
| Portability                | ✅ High           | ❌ Host-dependent    |
| Lifecycle with containers  | Independent       | Independent         |
| Permissions handling       | Docker-managed    | Must match host UID |
| Cross-platform consistency | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                |

---

#### 🧠 DCA Exam Tip

> ✅ Named volumes are best for production data because they're host-agnostic, Docker-managed, and automatically provisioned.


---

## 🔹 9. Networking

### 📌 What is it?

Docker provides virtual networks (bridge, overlay, host) to connect containers and expose services.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Alternative    | Limitation                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Host networking| No isolation                    |
| Manual IPs     | No automation                   |

### 🔧 What options exist?

| Network Driver | Description                            | Use Case                                      | Limitations                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **bridge**     | Default for standalone containers      | 🟢 Best for single-host, custom microservices | ❌ Doesn’t work across hosts                |
| **host**       | Container shares host network stack    | ⚠️ Low-latency apps (e.g., DNS servers)       | ❌ No isolation; port conflicts             |
| **overlay**    | Virtual network across Swarm/K8s nodes | 🟢 Multi-host communication via Swarm         | Requires Swarm mode or orchestration setup |
| **macvlan**    | Assigns MAC address on the local LAN   | 🟠 Legacy apps needing real IPs               | Complex setup; breaks DNS-based discovery  |
| **none**       | No networking                          | 🔒 Air-gapped or IPC-only containers          | No communication even with host            |

### ✅ Pros

- 🌐 Built-in DNS resolution by container name
    
- 🔒 Isolation between user-defined networks
    
- 🔁 Cross-container communication made easy
    

### ❌ Cons

- ⚠️ Default bridge limits are non-trivial (manual port mapping, no DNS unless defined in a user-defined bridge network)
    
- 🧱 Overlay networks need Swarm init and gossip protocol
    
- 🧪 Network plugins (CNI) not supported natively in Docker CE (K8s needed)

### 📦 Example

User-defined bridge with DNS support:

```bash
docker network create app-net
docker run -d --network app-net --name db postgres
docker run -d --network app-net --name app myapp  # app can resolve 'db'
```

Overlay in Swarm:

```bash
docker network create -d overlay web-overlay
docker service create --network web-overlay nginx
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

| Practice                                       | Why                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Use **user-defined bridge** for microservices  | Enables DNS-based service discovery           |
| Use **overlay** for Swarm deployments          | Required for multi-node networking            |
| Avoid **host mode** unless latency is critical | Host mode bypasses Docker’s isolation & DNS   |
| Use **network aliases** for legacy systems     | Helps emulate fixed hostnames inside networks |

### 📌 When to use which network mode

| Requirement                     | bridge | host | overlay | macvlan | none |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| Multi-container local setup     | ✅      | ❌    | ❌       | ❌       | ❌    |
| Multi-node Swarm service        | ❌      | ❌    | ✅       | ⚠️      | ❌    |
| Minimal-latency app (e.g., DNS) | ⚠️     | ✅    | ❌       | ❌       | ❌    |
| Air-gapped containers (sandbox) | ❌      | ❌    | ❌       | ❌       | ✅    |
| Need real IP on LAN             | ❌      | ❌    | ❌       | ✅       | ❌    |

## 🔹 10. Docker Swarm

### 📌 What is it?

Docker Swarm is Docker’s built-in **container orchestration** tool for managing services across multiple nodes (hosts).

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Orchestrator   | Comparison                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Kubernetes     | More features, but complex        |
| Nomad          | Simpler, less Docker-native       |

### ✅ Pros

- 🧩 Built into Docker CLI
- 🔁 Rolling updates
- 🔐 Secure by default (mTLS, RAFT)
- 🧠 Simple learning curve

### ❌ Cons

- 📉 Limited ecosystem
- ⛔ Lacks advanced Kubernetes features (CRDs, operators)

### 📦 Example

```bash
docker swarm init
docker service create --replicas 3 nginx
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Use `docker stack deploy` with Compose files
- Secure join tokens
- Use healthchecks and constraints for scheduling

### 📌 When to use

| Use Case            | Use Swarm? |
|---------------------|------------|
| Simple prod clusters| ✅ Yes     |
| HA, multi-cloud     | ⚠️ K8s better |
| Learning orchestration | ✅ Good start |

---

## 🔹 11. Stack Files

### 📌 What is it?

A Docker Stack file (`docker-compose.yml`) is a YAML-based configuration used with `docker stack deploy` in Swarm mode to define multi-container applications with networking, volumes, and services.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Tool               | Limitation                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `docker run`       | Too verbose for complex setups   |
| Kubernetes YAML    | More powerful, less user-friendly|

### ✅ Pros

- 🧱 Declarative and versionable
- 🔗 Includes networking, volumes, scaling
- 📁 Familiar to Compose users

### ❌ Cons

- ⚠️ Not as powerful as Kubernetes specs
- 📉 Not compatible with Compose v2 features in all cases

### 📦 Example

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

### 🛠 Best Practices

- Keep services modular
- Use `.env` for secrets/overrides
- Store in Git

### 📌 When to use

| Scenario                   | Use Stack File? |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Swarm deployment           | ✅ Required     |
| Local dev                  | ⚠️ Use Compose  |
| Kubernetes environments    | ❌ Use K8s YAML |

---

## 🔹 12. Docker Orchestration Options

### 📌 What is it?

Container orchestration enables scheduling, scaling, and lifecycle management across multiple hosts.

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Tool          | Pros                           | Cons                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Swarm         | Simple, Docker-native          | Limited features            |
| Kubernetes    | Feature-rich, ecosystem        | Complex to manage           |
| Nomad         | Lightweight, multi-runtime     | Less adoption               |

### ✅ Pros of Orchestration

- ⚙️ Automated scaling & deployment
- 🔄 Self-healing containers
- 📡 Service discovery
- 🛡 Secure defaults (RBAC, mTLS)

### ❌ Cons

- 📚 Steep learning curve (esp. K8s)
- ⚠️ More moving parts
- 💵 Increased operational overhead

### 📌 When to use what

### 🧠 Addendum: `docker node update --availability`: Control Node Scheduling Status in Docker Swarm

This command is used to **manually change the availability of a Swarm node**, affecting whether the node is eligible to run tasks (containers).

#### 📌 Syntax

```bash
docker node update --availability <availability-option> <node-name>
```

#### 🔁 Available Options

|Option|Description|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|`active`|Node is fully operational and **can receive new tasks**.|Default state. Use when the node is healthy and should participate in the swarm.|
|`pause`|Node **does not receive new tasks**, but keeps running existing tasks.|Use during maintenance where you don’t want new tasks, but don’t want disruption.|
|`drain`|Node **stops all tasks** and **migrates them** to other active nodes.|Use before shutting down or restarting a node to prevent downtime.|

#### ⚙️ Example Commands

- Drain a node for safe shutdown:
    
    ```bash
    docker node update --availability drain docker02
    ```
    
- Resume task scheduling on a node:
    
    ```bash
    docker node update --availability active docker02
    ```
    
- Pause a node temporarily (no new tasks, keep current ones):
    
    ```bash
    docker node update --availability pause docker02
    ```
    

#### 🛍️ Best Practices

- Use `drain` before performing OS updates or hardware maintenance to **avoid service interruptions**.
    
- Use `pause` when troubleshooting but want services to remain temporarily running.
    
- Always switch back to `active` when the node is ready to **rejoin the swarm scheduling pool**.

## 🔹 13. Replicated vs Global Services

### 📌 What is it?

In Swarm, services can be deployed as:

- **Replicated**: X copies across nodes
- **Global**: 1 copy per node

### 🔧 What else is used?

| Mode      | Purpose                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Replicated| Scale apps like web servers |

## 🛡️ Addendum: Docker Bench for Security

A shell script maintained by Docker Inc. that **automates CIS Docker Benchmark checks** to assess Docker host and container security in production.

### 🔍 What It Does

- Scans host and container configurations for common security issues (e.g., config files, daemon settings, host partitioning, runtime hardening)
    
- Reports findings as **PASS**, **WARN**, **INFO**, or **NOTE**
    
- Calculates an overall **security “score”** based on PASS results
    

---

### ⚙️ Installation & Execution

#### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
```

#### Run via Docker

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --net host --pid host --userns host \
  --cap-add audit_control \
  -e DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=$DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST \
  -v /etc:/etc:ro \

|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Production deployments       | ✅ Yes              |
| Internal dev images          | ⚠️ Optional         |
| Public image distribution    | ✅ Critical         |

## 🧠 Docker DCA Exam Tips (Callouts)

These callouts are short facts and reminders designed to help you prepare for the Docker Certified Associate (DCA) exam. Place them as side-notes or 🧠 tip boxes in your markdown files or README guides.

---

### ✅ General

- ✅ Understand that Docker containers share the host kernel (unlike VMs).
- ✅ Images are built from the bottom up; layers are cached unless invalidated.
- ✅ Default network mode for user-defined networks is **bridge**, and DNS is enabled.

---

### 🔹 Storage & Volumes

- ✅ `overlay2` is the default storage driver on most modern Linux distros.
- ✅ Bind mounts depend on host paths and can lead to portability issues.
- ✅ Named volumes are managed by Docker and persist even after container deletion.

---

### 🔹 Dockerfiles & Builds

- ✅ Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new image layer.
- ✅ Best practice: Use `.dockerignore` to reduce build context size.
- ✅ Use `--no-cache` if you want to skip layer cache during builds.

---

### 🔹 Container Runtime

- ✅ PID 1 in a container must handle signals correctly (trap SIGTERM).
- ✅ Use `tini` or `dumb-init` to avoid zombie processes.

---

### 🔹 Networking

- ✅ `bridge` is the default driver for containers on a single host.
- ✅ `host` network shares the host stack — no isolation.
- ✅ `overlay` networks enable multi-host communication (Swarm).

---

### 🔹 Swarm & Orchestration

- ✅ `docker swarm init` promotes a node to manager.
- ✅ Swarm uses **mTLS** and **Raft** consensus for secure clustering.
- ✅ Global services run one task per node; replicated services scale arbitrarily.

---

### 🔹 Registry & Image Signing

- ✅ Docker Hub has pull rate limits for unauthenticated users.
- ✅ Use `cosign` or Docker Content Trust (DCT) for signing and verification.

---

### 🔹 Security

- ✅ Trivy scans both OS packages and app dependencies.
- ✅ You must secure Docker API with TLS in production environments.
- ✅ UCP supports LDAP and RBAC, but is part of Docker Enterprise.

---

### 🔹 Kubernetes Integration (For Volume Topics)

- ✅ Kubernetes uses PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for dynamic storage binding.
- ✅ CSI (Container Storage Interface) is the standard for storage drivers in K8s.

---

### 🔹 Monitoring, Logs, and Backup

- ✅ `docker logs` only shows stdout/stderr — no access logs.
- ✅ Use log drivers (e.g. json-file, syslog) to ship logs externally.
